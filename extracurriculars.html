				<p>My main extracurricular is Model UN. Model UN is a club where you travel to different colleges and act as though you are a part of the United Nations. Every person represents a country and at the end of the weekend, different awards are given out. I’ve been on the team for the past two years and am currently on the executive board serving as the Social Chair. Here are some of the conferences that I have attended: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>McMUN</li>
					<li>ChoMUN</li>
					<li>TrojanMUN</li>
					<li>HNMUN</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Cross College Advising</h2>
				<p>I am currently working for Cross College advising as a peer advisor. As a peer advisor, I provide academic advice to undecided students. I help students create their schedules, navigate DARS, and explore different major options. I also help run events for the office where we offer advice to multiple students and advertise our office.</p>

				<p>The Schuman Challenge is a foreign affairs contest for undergrads where teams from different universities create policies for the European Union and then present the policy to the EU ambassador to the US. I am a part of UW’s team this year and we are creating a policy about Space Traffic Management.</p>
