					<p>Iâ€™m currently in my 2nd year of college majoring in Information Science. I was originally majoring in Computer Science but I made the switch at the start of last semester. I am also pursuing certificates in Computer Science and Game Design. Some interesting Information Science classes that I have taken include LIS 470: Interaction Design Studio, LIS 340: Cyberlaw, and LIS 640: Information Economy and Cybersecurity. I have also completed the intro programming sequence by taking Programming I-III for Computer Science. I am currently taking a digital art class for my Game Design certificate.</p>

					<p> Before college, I attended high school in New Jersey at a school called Gill St. Bernards. My favorite class in high school was physics and I was planning on majoring in it at college, however, I quickly changed my mind when I got to school. I also took many art classes in high school which inspired me to pursue a certificate in Game Design.
